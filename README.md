# ðŸ”¥ Firebase Image Provider

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/firebase_image.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_image)

A cached Flutter ImageProvider for Firebase Cloud Storage image objects.

## Fork setup

In `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
  firebase_image:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/tekartikdev/firebase_image
    version: '>=0.4.0'
```
## How to use

Make sure you already have [Firebase set up](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) on all platforms you want to use this on.

Supply the `FirebaseImage` widget with the image's URI (e.g. `gs://bucket123/userIcon123.jpg`) and then put that in any widget that accepts an `ImageProvider` (most image related widgets will (e.g. `Image`, `ImageIcon`, etc.)). Please note that you do need the `gs://` prefix currently.

See the below for example code.

## How does it work?
The code downloads the image (object) into memory as a byte array.

Unless disabled using the `cacheRefreshStrategy: CacheRefreshStrategy.NEVER` option, it gets the object's last update time from metadata (a millisecond precision integer timstamp) and uses that as a defacto version number. Therefore, any update to that remote object will result in the new version being downloaded.

The image byte array in memory then gets saved to a file in the temporary directory of the app and that location is saved in a persistant database. The OS can clean up this directory at any time however.

Metadata retrival is a 'Class B Operation' and has 50,000 free operations per month. After that, it is billed at $0.04 / 100,000 operations and so the default behaviour of `cacheRefreshStrategy: CacheRefreshStrategy.BY_METADATA_DATE` may incur extra cost if the object never changes. This makes this implementation a cost effective stratergy for caching as the entire object doesn't have to be transfered just to check if there have been any updates. Essentailly, any images will only need to be downloaded once per device.

## Example
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_image/firebase_image.dart';

class IconImage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Firebase Image Provider example'),
      ),
      body: Image(
        image: FirebaseImage('gs://bucket123/userIcon123.jpg'),
        // Works with standard parameters, e.g.
        fit: BoxFit.fitWidth,
        width: 100,
        // ... etc.
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## To Do

- [x] Add examples to [pub.dev](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_image#-example-tab-)
- [ ] Clear items from cache if they haven't been accessed after a certain amount of time (2 weeks?)
- [ ] Add more documentation/comments
- [ ] Create unit tests
